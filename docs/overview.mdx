## Introduction

The AVM Web Provider is an interface that bridges the gap between dApps and providers (wallets), allowing dApps to connect and interact with providers (wallets) in a standardized way.

The AVM Web Provider works towards achieving three main goals:

1. Creating a common interface between dApps and providers (wallets).
2. Allowing dApps to choose what wallet to use.

## How it works

Traditionally, web-based providers inject script into a web page's document and "hijack" a property on the global object. This can be problematic for a user that may use multiple providers and could lead to provider B overwriting this global property that was already initialized by provider A.

It is also common for web-based providers to use injected code to use the [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) for  communication to the extension's content scripts. This opens up a dApp to cross-origin communication; any messages sent to via [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) can be received by a page, and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it.

As of March 2022, the [`BroadcastChannel`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel) API is fully supported by all major browsers and is a clean and efficient way to broadcast/listen for messages. It provides several advantages over [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage):
* It provides a higher-level abstraction for communication. It is simpler to use compared to manually injecting scripts and handling [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) events.
* It is limited to a named channel and the same origin, meaning only the origin page, the dapp, and the browsing context (for instance, a web extension's content script) can broadcast/listen to messages.

The AVM Web Provider leverages the [`BroadcastChannel API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel) as a transport layer to deliver messages and allows dApps and web-based providers to securely communicate without interfering with other providers.

A dApp will broadcast a message and the provider(s) will listen for these broadcasted messages and act upon them, responding with another broadcast message that references the original request broadcast.

The dApp will, itself, listen to broadcasted responses from any provider(s). Below is a diagram demonstrating a web extension provider for the flow of data for an enable request.
